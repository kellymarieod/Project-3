      <p class="him"> Hey! We haven't talked in a while. How've you been? </p>
      <p class="her"> Hey! I've been doing ok. Got a new job. Hbu? </p>
      <p class="him"> Pretty good, all things considered. </p>
      <p class="her"> :) </p>
      <p class="him"> What's the new job? </p>
      <p class="her"> Pretty much doing the same thing for a different department. It's not very exciting, but I get to work with different people. </p>
      <p class="him"> That sounds like a good change of pace. Did you ever get that thing sorted out with your mom? </p>
      <p class="her"> Oh yeah. That was like a year ago! Yeah, I guess you could say it's "sorted out". </p>
      <p class="him"> Has it really been a year since we talked? </p>
      <p class="her"> Yeah, just about. </p>
      <p class="him"> Wow. </p>
      <p class="him"> I saw your post about your breakup. I'm sorry to hear that. </p>
      <p class="her"> Thanks. It was time. </p>
      <p class="him"> Yeah, it's still hard to lose someone. I can't believe you dated for 7 years. </p>
      <p class="her"> Me neither. Especially since 5 of them were so unhappy. </p>
      <p class="him"> You deserve better. </p>
      <p class="her"> I don't think it's a question of deserving, but thanks. </p>
      <p class="him"> Of all the people I know, I think you deserve the most to be happy. You work so hard. You're so kind and supportive of everyone else. You're seriously the strongest woman I know. </p>
      <p class="her"> Haha, thanks... But I don't think you just earn your way to happiness. It seems more ellusive than that. I think maybe happiness isn't the goal anyway. </p>
      <p class="him"> Oh yeah? What is then? </p>
      <p class="her"> Growth. Change. </p>
      <p class="her"> Like are you moving forward? Are you becoming something more than you've always been? </p>
      <p class="him"> I like that. I think that's a better goal than happiness. </p>
      <p class="her"> At least it's one you have more control over... </p>
